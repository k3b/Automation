* Fixed: Added device admin permission for start-phone-call action
* Fixed: Trigger "battery is charging" would only fire once and not after disconnecting and connecting charger
* Change: Was forced to raise targetSdk to 32 for Google Play version. If that should break something, consider switching to the F-Droid or APK version.
