It's quite hard to keep this app working across the many different hardwares as well as the many changes Android undergoes over the versions. I can test it in the emulator, but that cannot show all bugs.
So if a certain feature is not working on your device - let me know. Over the years I have fixed almost all bugs that have been reasonably reported to me. But for that I'm dependend on your input.

If you have a problem and think about contacting me please
- update to the latest version first and see if your problem persists there, too.
- check this list of known problems first: https://server47.de/automation/index.php#knownProblems

Donations are certainly a good, but not the only way to motivate me :-)
* If you'd like to support me, you can also leave a positive review for the app on Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jens.automation2).
* If you like the app, simply some warm words via email are always appreciated.
* Furthermore I can always use help in translating the app. English, German and some Spanish are among my own skills. Italiano e russo sono già coperti. But everything else is more than welcome.
* If you have a talent/experience in graphics design and have some ideas for nicer icons let me know.
* If you have an interesting use-case or found a way to combine triggers and actions to achieve something intriguing and you think it's worth putting it on the examples page (https://server47.de/automation/examples.html), let me know.
