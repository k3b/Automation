    <string name="timeframes">TimeFrames</string>
    <string name="helpTextTimeFrame">If you specify a rule with a timeframe you have two choices. You can choose between entering OR leaving a timeframe. Either way a rule is triggered only once. So if you create a rule that has \"entering timeframe xyz\" as trigger and let it change your sound profile to vibrate that does not mean that the phone will automatically go to ring if the timeframe is over. If you want that you need to specify another rule with another timeframe.</string>
    <string name="helpTextSound">On the main screen you can use lock sound changes to temporarily avoid rule based sound changes. E.g. you may be in a situation or place where usually ringtones are ok, but this one time it would be disturbing. The feature will automatically deactivate once the configured time has elapsed. Click the + button to add the given amount of time. Once it is active you may deactivate it again using the toggle button (and that way enable rule based sound changes again).</string>
    <string name="toggableRules">Toggable rules</string>
    <string name="helpTextToggable">Rules have a flag called \"Toggable\". This means that if a rule is executed and afterwards the same triggers apply again the rule will be executed in an opposite mode where applicable. Currently this will only happen in conjunction with NFC tags. If you tap them twice and there\'s a toggable rule associated with it it will do the opposite of the current situation, e.g. deactivate wifi if it\'s currently activated.</string>
    <string name="helpTextProcessMonitoring">If you specify a rule with a process monitor the application will check for that process every x seconds (you can change that in settings). I know that can be kind of slow, but continuous monitoring would drain the battery to fast. And there is no broadcast from the OS for that event.</string>

You can setup the percentage value from which Automation will accept a result. Two remarks: 1) More than 1 status could occur at the same time. For example you might be WALKING inside a driving bus. 2) This sensor is relatively expensive in terms of battery usage. If it is possible you might consider using alternatives, e.g. require your car\'s handsfree device to be connected to detect you\'re driving.</string>

    <string name="locationEngineDisabledLong">Unfortunately your location cannot be determined anymore. A debt of gratitude is owed to Google for its infinite wisdom and amiableness.\\n\\nLet me explain this further. Starting with Android 10 a new permission was introduced that is needed to determine your location in the background (which of course is required for an app like this). Whilst I consider that a good idea in general the chicanery it involves for developers is not.\\n\\nWhen developing an app you can try to qualify for this permission by abiding to a catalog of requirements. Unfortunately new versions of my app have been rejected over a period of three months. I fulfilled all those requirements, Google\'s shitty development support claimed I would not. After giving them proof that I did after all - I got a response like \"I cannot help you anymore\". Eventually I gave up. \\n\\nAs a consequence the Google Play version can NOT use your location as a trigger anymore. My only alternative option would have been to have this application removed from the store entirely.\\n\\nI\'m very sorry about that, but I\'ve tried my best arguing with a \"support\" that repeatedly failed to pass the Turing test.\\n\\nThe good news: You can still have it all!\\n\\nAutomation is now open source and can be found in F-Droid. That is an app store that really cares about your privacy - rather than just acting like that. Simply backup your config file, uninstall this app, install it again from F-Droid, restore your config file - done.\\n\\nClick here to find out more:</string>

    <string name="notificationTriggerExplanation">This trigger will respond to other applications opening notifications in the notification area (or such being closed). You can specify another application from which the notification has to come from. If you don\'t the notifications from any other application will count. You can also specify strings that must be or must not be in their title or notification body. The comparison is done case-INsensitive.</string>
    <string name="postsNotification">%1$s posts notification</string>

    <string name="playSound">Play sound</string>
    <string name="alwaysPlay">always play</string>
    <string name="alwaysPlayExplanation">If this settings is active the sound will always be played. If it is deactivated it will only play if your phone is neither on mute nor vibrate. However if active it will not have an effect on the volume. So if your phone is on ring mode it will not increase the media volume for example. So if media volume is on mute you won\'t hear anything either.</string>
    <string name="selectSoundFile">Select sound file</string>
    <string name="fileDoesNotExist">File does not exist.</string>
    <string name="noFileManageInstalled">No file manager installed.</string>
    <string name="shareConfigAndLogFilesWithDev">Attach config and log files.</string>
    <string name="shareConfigAndLogExplanation">This will start a new email with your config and log files attached as zip file. It will not be sent automatically, you still need to hit \"send\". You can also change the recipient to yourself for example.</string>
    <string name="startAppChoiceNote">Here you have 2 general options:\n\n1. You can start a program by selecting an activity. Imagine this like preselecting a specific screen/window of an application. Keep in mind this may not always work. This is because the windows of an app might interact with each other, e.g. pass on parameters. When bluntly starting a specific screen that interaction has not happened and the window might close instantly (therefore it\'s never really shown). Try it nevertheless! You can enter an activity path manually, but it\'s recommended to use the \"Select\" button. If you decide to enter it manually enter the app\'s package name in the upper field and the full path of the activity in the lower one.\n\n2. Selection by action In contrast to selecting a specific window you can also start a program by an action. This is like shouting out \"I\'d would like xyz\" and if there\'s an app installed that can help you with that it will be started. A good example would be start browser - you might even have multiple installed (one is usually the default one). You need to enter this manually, PackageName is optional here. Keep in mind no variables will be resolved. If you want to start the camera for example using \"MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE\" will not work. You have to take a look at the Android documentation and use this variable\'s actual value instead which in this example would be \"android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE\".</string>

You may enter it manually, copy &amp; paste it from somewhere or pick one from the list of suggestions. As this trigger is meant to be and remain very flexible I cannot provide you with explanations for the items.\n\nThe list of suggestions does not claim to be complete. Please visit the below URL to have a look at the Android documentation.\nAlso any app can send custom events which will not appear in the Android documentation of course.\n\nMany broadcasts require specific permissions in order to work. I try to request permissions where I know they will be required.

On a regular Android system (without root) this is actually the hard part.\n\n2. That also means Automation must be able to execute the file, not just the owner or the group.\n\n3. If it is a script, a valid shell be specified in the script\'s header.\n\nIf you cannot meet the above requirements, you could alternatively try to specify a shell as the actual executable (like /system/bin/sh) and your script as parameter.
